			let age2 = age;
			console.log(age, age2);
			age = 200;
			console.log(age, age2);

			let name = 'Patrick';

			name = 'Partrick';

			// Let's say we have an array
			const players = ['Patrick', 'Sarah', 'Jeffrey', 'Carl'];

			// and we want to make a copy of it.
			const team  = players;

			console.log(players, team);

			// You might think we can just do something like this:
			team[3] = 'Partrice';

			// however what happens when we update that array?

			// now here is the problem!

			// oh no - we have edited the original array too!

			// Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

			// So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
			const team2 = players.slice();
			const team3 = [].concat(players); 

			// one day

			// or create a new array and concat the old one in

			// or use the new ES6 Spread
			const team4 = [...players];
			team4[3] = 'Julian Speroni';

			const team5 = Array.from(players);


			// now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

			// The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

			// with Objects
			const person = {
				name: 'Scott Dann',
				age: 29
			}
			console.log(person);

			// and think we make a copy:
			// const captain = person;
			// captain.age = 34;

			// how do we take a copy instead?
			const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 6, age: 34 });
			console.log(captain2);

			// We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
			// const captain3 = {...person}; - not yet supported

			// Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

			const schluppy = {
				name: 'Jeff',
				age: 26,
				social: {
					twitter: '@jeffschlupp',
					facebook: 'jeffschlupp'
				}
			}
			
			const footballer = Object.assign({}, schluppy);

			console.log(schluppy);
			console.log(footballer);
			// In this example if you set schluppy.social.twitter to another value it will change in both objects because Object.assign only goes one level deep.
